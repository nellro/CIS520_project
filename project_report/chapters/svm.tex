\subsection{Support Vector Machine}
\label{sec:svm}

We used a polynomial kernel:
\begin{equation*}
G(x_{j},x_{k}) = (1+x_{j}’ x_{k})^{q}
\end{equation*}
Cross-validation procedure was performed to determine the best 
parameter value $q\in\{2,3,4\}$. Cross-validation was based 
on the accuracy measures. The performance results are presented in 
the Table~\ref{tbl:res}. 

In addition to the basis SVM model trained on the $12$-features 
extracted using methodology from Section~\ref{sec:data}, we trained 
three more models to analyze possible improvements. First, na\"ive 
approach, uses a sequence of the heart-beat timings as an input to 
the model.
Second approach uses \textit{Fast Fourier Transform} (FFT) 
representation of the initial EGM signal. In this case, the 
features are the amplitudes and phases of $k=10$ frequencies with 
highest amplitude. 
Third approach performs \textit{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) 
on the FFT spectrum to do the frequency-choosing part: rather than 
pick $k$ frequencies with 
highest amplitude, pick the ones that are ortho-normal and maximize 
the variance. 
Our experiments showed that FFT with PCA model achieves the highest 
accuracy of $94.3\%$, but the training time is high, $7.89$ sec. On 
the other hand, the 
basis SVM model showed the second best 
accuracy of $93.4\%$, with training time being only $0.09$ sec.
  
\paragraph{Implementation.}
The MATLAB built-in function $\mathtt{fitcsvm}$ was used to train an 
SVM model and do predictions.

%We believe that on EGM VT and SVT samples would have very different 
%signatures, which makes them separable with linear or other 
%relatively “simple” kernels SVM. And the SVM part majorly focus on 
%which type of selection of features would give better performance. 
%The raw data is sequences of EGM signal, which are: \\
%1.	Long and large (average about 20000 integers per instance). \\
%2.	For real data set, instances are of different length (because 
%real parents are measured for different length of time), which can 
%vary from 400 to 40000 (integers) per instance. \\
%It’s obvious that raw data’s pre-processing would be necessary. 

%In this section we will analyze four methods of features extraction. 
%The 
%models are all SVM with polynomial kernel, which are determined by 
%best their performance. 

%First, a na\"ive approach is to pick the time of the heart beat in 
%EGM signal. We take first $n$ 
%heart beat moments (truncate the heart-beat moment sequence because 
%raw data’s difference in length, and in this case 76 integers per 
%instance), give extracted data to SVM model. 

%Yet just to ignore signal with relatively low intensity causes 
%information loss, and additional information could be the key to 
%improve model's performance. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes 12 
%features with biological meaning that could be used for 
%training/testing. Such approach gives better performance than 
%na\"ive 
%approach.

%In addition, the feature extraction procedures are performed on the 
%whole raw data, which is the whole EGM signal within given time 
%period, which might take a long time to measure. In real time 
%life-or-death situation, even a few seconds could be the difference 
%between survival and fatality. We want to find a method which gives 
%us acceptable error while time-saving in data pre-processing. So we 
%turn to Real Time Fast Fourier Transform. FFT will transform signal 
%in time domain to frequency domain, and amplitude represents energy 
%of this frequency. A natural idea is to take information of several 
%frequencies with highest energy, so that we believe the wave they 
%reconstructed is closed enough to original one and information loss 
%becomes trivial. So this time the features are the frequency, 
%amplitude and phase of $k$ frequencies with highest amplitude (In 
%this case, 10 frequencies are chosen). 

%And the fourth approach is to use PCA over the spectrum to do the 
%frequency-choosing part, rather than pick $k$ frequencies with 
%highest amplitude, since data given to model is ``some features of 
%many features'' (pick several frequencies among spectrum), which is 
%a 
%dimensional reduction task. 

%And as shown in chart, if we training time and RAM are enough, FFT 
%with PCA would have a best performance, and also meet the real-time 
%requirement; however, 12-features approach is also acceptable and 
%greatly reduced calculation amount needed.
