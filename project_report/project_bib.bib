	abstract="Motivated by the problem of verifying the correctness 
	of arrhythmia-detection algorithms, we present a formalization of 
	these algorithms in the language of Quantitative Regular 
	Expressions. QREs are a flexible formal language for specifying 
	complex numerical queries over data streams, with provable 
	runtime and memory consumption guarantees. The medical-device 
	algorithms of interest include peak detection (where a peak in a 
	cardiac signal indicates a heartbeat) and various discriminators, 
	each of which uses a feature of the cardiac signal to distinguish 
	fatal from non-fatal arrhythmias. Expressing these algorithms' 
	desired output in current temporal logics, and implementing them 
	via monitor synthesis, is cumbersome, error-prone, 
	computationally expensive, and sometimes infeasible.",
