\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In this project we will compare classification methods for 
electrogram (ECG) arrhythmia discrimination. The set of methods we 
analyze include Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), $k$-Nearest Neighbours (\knn) and Decision Tree.

The following two datasets will be used: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/}{The 
	MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database}~\cite{moody2001impact}. 
	It contains $48$ half-hour two-channel ECG recordings, obtained 
	from $47$ subjects. The 
	recordings are digitized at $360$ samples per second. 
	There are approximately $110,000$ ECG
	beats. 
%	in this database with $15$ different types of arrhythmia 
%including normal.
%	The subjects were 25 men aged 32 to 89 years, and 22 women aged 
%	23 to 89 years.
	\item EGM Database~\cite{jiang2016silico}. 
	% EGM - cardiac device incoming cardiac voltage signal
	It consists
	of $1920$ EGM signals, equally split into $960$ VTs and
	$960$ SVTs. The EGMs were generated by the heart
	model that has been validated for realism by 
	cardiologists~\cite{jiang2016silico}.
\end{itemize}
