Due to high importance of the problem, hundreds of methods for 
arrhythmia classification have been presented in the literature. 
Data-driven approaches for discrimination became popular in 1990s, 
many of them use machine learning techniques. 
For instance, in~\cite{jun2018ecg} authors perform multi-class 
classification of 
ECG signals using convolutional neural network (CNN) to discriminate 
the between seven sophisticated types of tachycardias including 
ventricular fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, paced 
beats, etc.

Authors in~\cite{assadi2015arrhythmias} present a $95.16\%$ accurate 
\knn classifier.
In 2012, other group of researchers report a $99.34\%$ accurate 
multi-class arrhythmia classification algorithm using 
\textit{ensemble decision trees}.

In \cite{mohanty2018ventricular} authors show that under specific 
conditions decision trees perform better than SVM classifiers.
